# simple-Web-server-By-C
Just Simple webserver using some libraries in ubuntu.

I read http://blog.manula.org/2011/05/writing-simple-web-server-in-c.html and start coding.
Very usefull tool is manuals of linux on some subjects like man listen,man connect,man socket ....Gave me power to start.

**I want to use just C built-it libraries as possibele.**
